# CryptoBator_

If you are like me and visited 10 different exchanges just to see the current price of the Crypto Currency of your interest before making an investment, then you should check out CryptoBator, an application that filters the current price of the Crypto Currency from the top exchanges and provide it under one roof, which is CryptoBater.

<p>As shown above, if users want to track the price of a certain crytoCurrency on multiple exchanges, they can enter the crypto ticker symbol (eg: BTC or DASH) and they will be able to see the real time value of the coin on multiple exchanges and a chart depicting 24H overview of the historical prices.</p>
