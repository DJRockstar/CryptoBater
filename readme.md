# CryptoBator_

If you are like me and visited 10 different exchanges just to see the current price of the Crypto Currency of your interest before making an investment, then you should check out CryptoBator, an application that filters the current price of the Crypto Currency from the top exchanges and provide it under one roof, which is CryptoBater.
